       <h3>What is the Difference between local storage and seassion storage method and cookies?</h3>
       <p>
        Local Storage
        <br>
         It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the clientâ€™s computer in the form of key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's memory is cleared.
       </p>
       <p>
        Session Storage
        <br>
       It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser until its current tab is on. Once you close the tab or terminate it, the data on session storage also gets lost. We can also set and retrieve its data using setItem() and getItem() methods, respectively, similar to the local storage methods
       </p>
      
       <p>
        Cookies 
        <br>
        Cookies are use in JavaScript using cookie property of Document object. This property is readable and writable both. A cookie is an old technology used in web browsers as client-side storage which works by server-side scripting languages like ASP, PHP, etc. Cookies can be created, modified, and also accessed.
       </p>
       <h3>What is event loop ?</h3>
       <p>
        If we run multiple JavaScript codes simultaneously, the JavaScript engine will execute them one after the other, but if any of the codes is scheduled to be executed after a certain time, it will keep a note on its stack, and it will run after that time. The thing that does this is what we call an event loop.
